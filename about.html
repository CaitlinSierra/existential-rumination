<h1> About the Creator: </h1>

<h2> Caitlin Fettig â€“ </h2> 

<p> is a Junior at George Fox University. Currently studying social work.. even more currently deciding that Social Work is not her future. From this realization she has begun to expand her talents by creating psychodynamic theories based on life experience. 

<h2>Words from the Author</h2>

<p> "Throughout the past few years I have been given the opportunity to formulate this experiential concept. This definition was essentially derived from introspection regarding my own mortality, through observation of the powerlessness we mere mortals possess. After struggling with a mental disorder, I was forced to obtain a new perspective concerning my life objectives. I began to realize that psychoanalytic methods merely served as child-sized band aids on my amputated limb. I came to the harsh realization that my skewed mindset was indefinitely linked to my own human selfishness due to my inherent sinful nature."
